# Would You Rather app

#### Introduction
Based off the Would You Rather game.

### Coding style & conventions
This project uses [ESLint](https://eslint.org/), [Prettier](https://prettier.io/), and [StyleLint](https://stylelint.io/).
The style config files have been trialed and tested so sticking to them makes for great conventions and best practices throughout the code.

For IDEs like WebStorm and PyCharm, you can go to `Preferences | Tools | File Watchers` and add automatic watchers for ESLint and Prettier on any files you choose. Upon pressing save the watchers will auto-lint your changes for ease of use.

### Getting Started
#### Setup Front End
This app uses `Yarn` as it's package manager. Navigate to the frontend directory and use `yarn` to install the dependencies in the `package.json` file. This will generate a `yarn.lock` file. It's advisable to commit this file as and when it is updated.

Once the dependencies are installed, run `yarn start` to run the front end on `port 3000`.
